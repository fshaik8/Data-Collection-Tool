## Project Overview

The Data Collection Tool for AgTech is a Python-based application designed to gather external data relevant to fertilizer inventory and demand planning. This tool is built with future adaptability and scalability in mind, allowing for the easy integration of additional data sources related to various agricultural products.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily add or modify data sources.
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Fetch data from various APIs and web sources.
- **Structured Storage**: Save data in JSON or CSV formats.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Robust logging and error handling for smooth operation.
- **Configuration Files**: Use configuration files to specify data sources and parameters.

## Task Objectives

The tool is capable of collecting data from two of the following external datasets:
1. **Industry Sales Trends**: Historical sales data of fertilizers within the agricultural sector.
2. **Economic Indicators**: Relevant economic indicators that might influence fertilizer demand (e.g., GDP, interest rates).
3. **Social Media Trends**: Trends and sentiment related to agriculture and fertilizers from social media platforms.
4. **Government Websites**: Data on agricultural policies, subsidies, and regulations.
5. **Competitor Data**: Data on competitor activities, pricing strategies, and market share within the agricultural fertilizer industry.
6. **Crop Data**: Information on planted acres and yield forecasts.
7. **Transport Data**: Information on freight costs and shipping times.
8. **Crop Yield Data**: Historical crop yield data to identify patterns and correlations.

- [USDA ARMS API Documentation](USDA_ARMS_API.md)

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Tool
To run the data collection tool, use the following command:
```sh
python Data_Collection_Tool.ipynb
```

### Example Configuration
Here's an example of how to configure your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
data_sources:
  USDA_ARMS:
    base_url: "http://example.com/usda"
    endpoints:
      endpoint1:
        path: "/data1"
        params: {...}
      endpoint2:
        path: "/data2"
        params: {...}
  FRED:
    base_url: "http://example.com/fred"
    endpoints:
      endpoint1:
        path: "/data1"
        params: {...}
      endpoint2:
        path: "/data2"
        params: {...}
```

### Data Storage
The collected data will be stored in structured files (e.g., CSV, JSON).
